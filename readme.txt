--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from 
many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and 
understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even 
require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers 
today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing 
them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. 
We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or 
example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is 
or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way 
to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass 
off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the 
work that you produce and submit must be your own.
